You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]\r\n\r\n- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]] via VS Code.\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note\r\n\r\n- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any Markdown parser.

They automatically show you which notes reference your current note, creating a web of interconnected knowledge that reveals surprising relationships between your ideas.\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Understanding and using backlinks in Foam]_\r\n\r\n## What Are Backlinks?\r\n\r\nA backlink is a connection from another note that points to the note you're currently viewing. While you create forward links intentionally with `[[wikilinks]]`, backlinks are discovered automatically by Foam.\r\n\r\n### Forward Links vs. Backlinks\r\n\r\n**Forward Links** (what you create):\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# Machine Learning Note\r\n\r\nI'm studying [[Neural Networks]] and [[Deep Learning]] concepts.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Backlinks** (what Foam discovers):\r\nIf you're viewing the \"Neural Networks\" note, Foam shows you that \"Machine Learning Note\" links to it, even though you didn't explicitly create that reverse connection.\r\n\r\nThis bidirectional linking creates a richer knowledge network than traditional hierarchical folders.\r\n\r\n## Accessing Backlinks - Connections Panel\r\n\r\nThe Connections panel shows both forward links and backlinks:\r\n\r\n1. **Open Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)\r\n2. **Type \"connections\"** and select \"Explorer: Focus on Connections\"\r\n3. **Use the filter buttons** to show only backlinks, forward links, or all connections\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Finding and opening the backlinks panel]_\r\n\r\n## Using Backlinks for Knowledge Discovery\r\n\r\n### 1. Finding Unexpected Connections\r\n\r\nBacklinks often reveal relationships you didn't consciously create:\r\n\r\n**Example:** While reviewing a \"Productivity\" note, backlinks might show connections from:\r\n\r\n- A cooking recipe (time management for meal prep)\r\n- A fitness routine (efficient workout planning)\r\n- A work project (team productivity strategies)\r\n\r\nThese diverse connections can spark new insights and cross-domain learning.\r\n\r\n### 2. Identifying Important Concepts\r\n\r\nNotes with many backlinks are often central to your thinking:\r\n\r\n- **Hub concepts** that connect many ideas\r\n- **Frequently referenced** resources or definitions\r\n- **Bridge topics** that span multiple domains\r\n\r\n### 3. Building Context Around Ideas\r\n\r\nBacklinks provide context for how you use concepts across different areas:\r\n\r\n- How you apply the same principle in various projects\r\n- Evolution of your thinking about a topic over time\r\n- Different perspectives you've encountered on the same idea\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Using backlinks for knowledge discovery and research]_\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/features/custom-markdown-preview-styles/","title":"Custom Markdown Preview Styles"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Custom Markdown Preview Styles\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code allows you to use your own CSS in the Markdown preview tab.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nCustom CSS for the Markdown preview can be implemented by using the `\"markdown.styles\": []` setting in `settings.json`. The stylesheets can either be https URLs or relative paths to local files in the current workspace.\r\n\r\nFor example, to load a stylesheet called `Style.css`, we can update `settings.json` with the following line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"markdown.styles\": [\"Style.css\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Foam elements\r\n\r\n### Foam note & placeholder links\r\n\r\nIt is possible to custom style the links to a note or placeholder. The links are an `<a>` tag. For notes use the class `foam-note-link`, for placeholders use `foam-placeholder-link`.\r\n\r\n### Cyclic inclusion warnings\r\n\r\nFoams offers the functionality to include other notes in your note. This will be displayed in the preview tab. Foam recognises a cyclic inclusion of notes and will display a warning when detected. The following html is used and can be custom styled using the class `foam-cyclic-link-warning`.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"foam-cyclic-link-warning\">\r\n  Cyclic link detected for wikilink: ${wikilink}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/features/commands/","title":"Foam Commands"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Foam Commands\r\n\r\nFoam has various commands that you can explore by calling the command palette and typing \"Foam\".\r\n\r\nIn particular, some commands can be very customizable and can help with custom workflows and use cases.\r\n\r\n## foam-vscode.create-note command\r\n\r\nThis command creates a note.\r\nAlthough it works fine on its own, it can be customized to achieve various use cases.\r\nHere are the settings available for the command:\r\n\r\n- `notePath`: The path of the note to create. If relative it will be resolved against the workspace root.\r\n- `templatePath`: The path of the template to use. If relative it will be resolved against the workspace root.\r\n- `title`: The title of the note (that is, the `FOAM_TITLE` variable)\r\n- `text`: The text to use for the note. If also a template is provided, the template has precedence\r\n- `variables`: Variables to use in the text or template\r\n- `date`: The date used to resolve the FOAM*DATE*\\* variables. in `YYYY-MM-DD` format\r\n- `onFileExists?: 'overwrite' | 'open' | 'ask' | 'cancel'`: What to do in case the target file already exists\r\n\r\nTo customize a command and associate a key binding to it, open the key binding settings and add the appropriate configuration, here are some examples:\r\n\r\n- Create a note called `test note.md` with some text. If the note already exists, ask for a new name\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"key\": \"alt+f\",\r\n  \"command\": \"foam-vscode.create-note\",\r\n  \"args\": {\r\n    \"text\": \"test note ${FOAM_DATE_YEAR}\",\r\n    \"notePath\": \"test note.md\",\r\n    \"onFileExists\": \"ask\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create a note following the `weekly-note.md` template.

The edges of the graph represent either a link between two files or a file that contains a certain tag. A node in the graph will grow in size with the number of connections it has, representing stronger or more defined concepts and topics.\r\n\r\n### The `Show Graph` command\r\n\r\n1. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`**\r\n2. **Type \"Foam: Show Graph\"**\r\n3. **Press Enter**\r\n\r\nYou can set up a custom keyboard shortcut:\r\n\r\n1. **Go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts**\r\n2. **Search for \"Foam: Show Graph\"**\r\n3. **Assign your preferred shortcut**\r\n\r\n## Graph Navigation\r\n\r\nWith the Foam graph visualization you can:\r\n\r\n- highlight a node by hovering on it, to quickly see how it's connected to the rest of your notes\r\n- select one or more (by keeping `shift` pressed while selecting) nodes by clicking on them, to better understand the structure of your notes\r\n- navigate to a note by clicking on it's node while pressing `ctrl` or `cmd`\r\n- automatically center the graph on the currently edited note, to immediately see its connections\r\n\r\n## Filter View\r\n\r\nIf you only wish to view certain types of notes or tags, or want to hide linked attachment nodes then you can apply filters to the graph.\r\n\r\n- Open the graph view using the `Foam: Show Graph` command\r\n- Click the button in the top right corner of the graph view that says \"Open Controls\"\r\n- Expand the \"Filter By Type\" dropdown to view the selection of types that you can filter by\r\n- Uncheck the checkbox for any type you want to hide\r\n- The types displayed in this dropdown are defined by [[note-properties]] which includes Foam-standard types as well as custom types defined by you!\r\n\r\n![Graph filtering demo](../../assets/images/graph-filter.gif)\r\n\r\n## Custom Graph Styles\r\n\r\nThe Foam graph will use the current VS Code theme by default, but it's possible to customize it with the `foam.graph.style` setting.\r\n\r\n![Graph style demo](../../assets/images/graph-style.gif)\r\n\r\nA sample configuration object is provided below, you can provide as many or as little configuration as you wish:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"foam.graph.style\": {\r\n    \"background\": \"#202020\",\r\n    \"fontSize\": 12,\r\n    \"fontFamily\": \"Sans-Serif\",\r\n    \"lineColor\": \"#277da1\",\r\n    \"lineWidth\": 0.2,\r\n    \"particleWidth\": 1.0,\r\n    \"highlightedForeground\": \"#f9c74f\",\r\n    \"node\": {\r\n        \"note\": \"#277da1\",\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `background` background color of the graph, adjust to increase contrast\r\n- `fontSize` size of the title font for each node\r\n- `fontFamily` font of the title font for each node\r\n- `lineColor` color of the edges between nodes in the graph\r\n- `lineWidth` thickness of the edges between nodes\r\n- `particleWidth` size of the particle animation showing link direction when highlighting a node\r\n- `highlightedForeground` color of highlighted nodes and edges when hovering over a node\r\n- to style individual types of nodes jump to the next section: [Style Nodes By Type](#style-nodes-by-type)\r\n\r\n### Style Nodes by Type\r\n\r\nIt is possible to customize the style of a node based on the `type` property in the YAML frontmatter of the corresponding document.\r\n\r\nThere are a few default node types defined by Foam that are displayed in the graph:\r\n\r\n- `note` defines the color for regular nodes whose documents have not overridden the `type` property.\r\n- `placeholder` defines the color for links that don't match any existing note. This is a [[placeholder]] because no file with such name exists.\r\n  - see [[wikilinks]] for more info <!--NOTE: this placeholder link should NOT have an associated file. This is to demonstrate the custom coloring-->\r\n- `tag` defines the color for nodes representing #tags, allowing tags to be used as graph nodes similar to backlinks.\r\n  - see [[tags]] for more info\r\n- `feature` shows an example of how you can use note types to customize the graph. It defines the color for the notes of type `feature`\r\n  - see [[note-properties]] for details\r\n\r\nFor example the following `backlinking.md` note:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntype: feature\r\n---\r\n# Backlinking\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the following `settings.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"foam.graph.style\": {\r\n    \"background\": \"#202020\",\r\n    \"node\": {\r\n        \"note\": \"#277da1\",\r\n        \"placeholder\": \"#545454\",\r\n        \"tag\": \"#f9c74f\",\r\n        \"feature\": \"red\",\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill result in the following graph:\r\n\r\n![Style node by type](../../assets/images/style-node-by-type.png)\r\n\r\n## What's Next?\r\n\r\nWith graph view mastery, you're ready to explore advanced Foam features:\r\n\r\n1. **[[wikilinks]]** -

Both approaches work - choose what fits your workflow.\r\n\r\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\r\n[graph-view]: graph-view.md \"Graph Visualization\"\r\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/features/templates/","title":"Note Templates"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Note Templates\r\n\r\nFoam supports note templates which let you customize the starting content of your notes instead of always starting from an empty note.\r\n\r\nFoam supports two types of templates:\r\n\r\n- **Markdown templates** (`.md` files) - Simple templates with predefined content and variables\r\n- **JavaScript templates** (`.js` files) - Smart templates that can adapt based on context and make intelligent decisions\r\n\r\nBoth types of templates are located in the special `.foam/templates` directory of your workspace.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart\r\n\r\n### Creating templates\r\n\r\n**For simple templates:**\r\n\r\n- Run the `Foam: Create New Template` command from the command palette\r\n- OR manually create a regular `.md` file in the `.foam/templates` directory\r\n\r\n**For smart templates:**\r\n\r\n- Create a `.js` file in the `.foam/templates` directory (see [JavaScript Templates](#javascript-templates) section below)\r\n\r\n![Create new template GIF](../../assets/images/create-new-template.gif)\r\n\r\n### Using templates\r\n\r\nTo create a note from a template:\r\n\r\n- Run the `Foam: Create New Note From Template` command and follow the instructions. Don't worry if you've not created a template yet! You'll be prompted to create a new simple template if none exist.\r\n- OR run the `Foam: Create New Note` command, which uses the special default template (`.foam/templates/new-note.md` or `.foam/templates/new-note.js`, if it exists)\r\n\r\n![Create new note from template GIF](../../assets/images/create-new-note-from-template.gif)\r\n\r\n## Special templates\r\n\r\n### Default template\r\n\r\nThe default template is used by the `Foam: Create New Note` command. Foam will look for these templates in order:\r\n\r\n1. `.foam/templates/new-note.js` (JavaScript template)\r\n2. `.foam/templates/new-note.md` (Markdown template)\r\n\r\nCustomize this template to contain content that you want included every time you create a note.\r\n\r\n### Default daily note template\r\n\r\nThe daily note template is used when creating daily notes (e.g. by using `Foam: Open Daily Note`). Foam will look for these templates in order:\r\n\r\n1. `.foam/templates/daily-note.js` (JavaScript template)\r\n2. `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` (Markdown template)\r\n\r\nFor a simple markdown template, it is _recommended_ to define the YAML Front-Matter similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntype: daily-note\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n## JavaScript Templates\r\n\r\nJavaScript templates are a powerful way to create smart, context-aware note templates that can adapt based on the situation. Unlike static Markdown templates, JavaScript templates can make intelligent decisions about what content to include.\r\n\r\n**Use JavaScript templates when you want to:**\r\n\r\n- Create different note structures based on the day of the week, time, or date\r\n- Adapt templates based on where the note is being created from\r\n- Automatically find and link related notes in your workspace\r\n- Generate content based on existing notes or workspace structure\r\n- Implement complex logic that static templates cannot handle\r\n\r\n### Basic JavaScript template structure\r\n\r\nA JavaScript template is a `.js` file that exports a function returning note content, and optionally location:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// .foam/templates/daily-note.js\r\nasync function createNote({ trigger, foam, resolver, foamDate }) {\r\n  const today = dayjs();\r\n  // or you could use foamDate for day specific notes, see FOAM_DATE_* variables\r\n  // const day = dayjs(foamDate)\r\n  const formattedDay = today.format('YYYY-MM-DD');\r\n\r\n  // if you need a variable you can use the resolver\r\n  // const title = await resolver.resolveFromName('FOAM_TITLE');\r\n\r\n  console.log(\r\n    'Creating note for today: ' + formattedDay,\r\n    JSON.stringify(trigger)\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  let content = `# Daily Note - ${formattedDay}\r\n\r\n## Today's focus\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- \r\n`;\r\n\r\n  switch (today.day()) {\r\n    case 1: // Monday\r\n      content = `# Week Planning - ${formattedDay}\r\n\r\n## This week's goals\r\n- [ ] Goal 1\r\n- [ ] Goal 2\r\n\r\n## Focus areas\r\n- \r\n`;\r\n      break;\r\n    case 5: // Friday\r\n      content = `# Week Review - ${formattedDay}\r\n\r\n## What went well\r\n- \r\n\r\n## What could be improved\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Next week's priorities\r\n- \r\n`;\r\n      break;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    content,\r\n    filepath: `/weekly-planning/${formattedDay}.md`,\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n**Smart meeting notes:**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nasync function createNote({ trigger, foam, resolver }) {\r\n  const title = (await resolver.resolveFromName('FOAM_TITLE')) || 'Meeting';\r\n  const today = dayjs();\r\n  // Detect meeting type from title\r\n  const isStandup = title.toLowerCase().includes('standup');\r\n  const isReview = title.toLowerCase().includes('review');\r\n\r\n  let template = `# ${title} - ${today.format('YYYY-MM-DD')}\r\n\r\n`;\r\n\r\n  if (isStandup) {\r\n    template += `## What I did yesterday\r\n- \r\n\r\n## What I'm doing today\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Blockers\r\n- \r\n`;\r\n  } else if (isReview) {\r\n    template += `## What went well\r\n- \r\n\r\n## What could be improved\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Action items\r\n- [ ] \r\n`;\r\n  } else {\r\n    template += `## Agenda\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- \r\n\r\n## Action items\r\n- [ ] \r\n`;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    content: template,\r\n    filepath: `/meetings/${title}.md`,\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Template result format\r\n\r\nJavaScript templates must return an object with:\r\n\r\n- `content` (required): The note content as a string\r\n- `filepath` (required): Custom file path for the note\r\n  - NOTE: the path must be within the workspace.\r\n    - A relative path will be resolved based on the `onRelativePath` command configuration.\r\n    - An absolute path will be taken as is, if it falls within the workspace. Otherwise it will be considered to be from the workspace root\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nreturn {\r\n  content: '# My Note\\n\\nContent here...',\r\n  filepath: 'custom-folder/my-note.md',\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Security and limitations\r\n\r\nJavaScript templates run in a best-effort secured environment:\r\n\r\n- ✅ Can only run from trusted VS Code workspaces\r\n- ✅ Can access Foam workspace and utilities\r\n- ✅ Can use standard JavaScript features\r\n- ✅ Have a 30-second execution timeout\r\n- ❌ Cannot access the file system directly\r\n- ❌ Cannot make network requests\r\n- ❌ Cannot access Node.js modules\r\n\r\nThis increases the chances that templates stay safe while still being powerful enough for complex logic.\r\n\r\nSTILL - PLEASE BE AWARE YOU ARE EXECUTING CODE ON YOUR MACHINE. THIS SANDBOX IS NOT MEANT TO BE THE ULTIMATE SECURITY SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n**YOU MUST TRUST THE REPO CONTRIBUTORS**\r\n\r\n## Markdown templates\r\n\r\nMarkdown templates are a simple way to create notes\r\n\r\n**Use Markdown templates when you want to:**\r\n\r\n- Create simple, consistent note structures\r\n- Use basic variables and placeholders\r\n- Keep templates easy to read and modify\r\n\r\n### Variables\r\n\r\nMarkdown templates can use all the variables available in [VS Code Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables).\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can also use variables provided by Foam:\r\n\r\n| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\r\n| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| `FOAM_SELECTED_TEXT` | Foam will fill it with selected text when creating a new note, if any text is selected. Selected text will be replaced with a wikilink to the new                                                                                                                 |\r\n| `FOAM_TITLE`         | The title of the note. If used, Foam will prompt you to enter a title for the note.                                                                                                                                                                               |\r\n| `FOAM_TITLE_SAFE`    | The title of the note in a file system safe format. If used, Foam will prompt you to enter a title for the note unless `FOAM_TITLE` has already caused the prompt.                                                                                                |\r\n| `FOAM_SLUG`          | The sluggified title of the note (using the default github slug method). If used, Foam will prompt you to enter a title for the note unless `FOAM_TITLE` has already caused the prompt.                                                                           |\r\n| `FOAM_CURRENT_DIR`   | The current editor's directory path. Resolves to the directory of the currently active file, or falls back to workspace root if no editor is active. Useful for creating notes in the current directory context.                                                  |\r\n| `FOAM_DATE_*`        | `FOAM_DATE_YEAR`, `FOAM_DATE_MONTH`, `FOAM_DATE_WEEK`, `FOAM_DATE_DAY_ISO` etc. Foam-specific versions of [VS Code's datetime snippet variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables). Prefer these versions over VS Code's. |\r\n\r\n### `FOAM_DATE_*` variables\r\n\r\nFoam defines its own set of datetime variables that have a similar behaviour as [VS Code's datetime snippet variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables).\r\n\r\nSupported variables include:\r\n\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_YEAR`: 4-digit year (e.g. 2025)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_MONTH`: 2-digit month (e.g. 09)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_WEEK`: ISO 8601 week number (e.g. 37)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_WEEK_YEAR`: the year of the ISO 8601 week number. The year that contains the Thursday of the current week, may vary from calendar year near Jan 1. Often used with `FOAM_DATE_WEEK`.\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_DAY_ISO`: ISO 8601 weekday number (1-7, where Monday=1, Sunday=7)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_DATE`: 2-digit day of month (e.g. 15)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_DAY_NAME`: Full weekday name (e.g. Monday)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_DAY_NAME_SHORT`: Short weekday name (e.g. Mon)\r\n- `FOAM_DATE_HOUR`, `FOAM_DATE_MINUTE`, `FOAM_DATE_SECOND`, `FOAM_DATE_SECONDS_UNIX`, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, `FOAM_DATE_YEAR` has the same behaviour as VS Code's `CURRENT_YEAR`, `FOAM_DATE_SECONDS_UNIX` has the same behaviour as `CURRENT_SECONDS_UNIX`, etc. `FOAM_DATE_DAY_ISO` returns the ISO weekday number (Monday=1, Sunday=7), which is useful for ISO week date formats like `2025-W37-5`.\r\n\r\nBy default, prefer using the `FOAM_DATE_` versions. The datetime used to compute the values will be the same for both `FOAM_DATE_` and VS Code's variables, with the exception of the creation notes using the daily note template.\r\n\r\nFor more nitty-gritty details about the supported date formats, [see here](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/main/packages/foam-vscode/src/services/variable-resolver.ts).\r\n\r\n#### Relative daily notes\r\n\r\nWhen referring to daily notes, you can use the relative snippets (`/+1d`, `/tomorrow`, etc.). In these cases, the new notes will be created with the daily note template, but the datetime used should be the relative datetime, not the current datetime.\r\nBy using the `FOAM_DATE_` versions of the variables, the correct relative date will populate the variables, instead of the current datetime.\r\n\r\nFor example, given this daily note template (`.foam/templates/daily-note.md`):\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# $FOAM_DATE_YEAR-$FOAM_DATE_MONTH-$FOAM_DATE_DATE\r\n\r\n## Here's what I'm going to do today\r\n\r\n- Thing 1\r\n- Thing 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the `/tomorrow` snippet is used, `FOAM_DATE_` variables will be populated with tomorrow's date, as expected.\r\nIf instead you were to use the VS Code versions of these variables, they would be populated with today's date, not tomorrow's, causing unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhen creating notes in any other scenario, the `FOAM_DATE_` values are computed using the same datetime as the VS Code ones, so the `FOAM_DATE_` versions can be used in all scenarios by default.\r\n\r\n### Metadata\r\n\r\n**Markdown templates** can also contain metadata about the templates themselves. The metadata is defined in YAML \"Frontmatter\" blocks within the templates.\r\n\r\n| Name          | Description                                                                                                                      |\r\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| `filepath`    | The filepath to use when creating the new note. If the filepath is a relative filepath, it is relative to the current workspace. |\r\n| `name`        | A human readable name to show in the template picker.                                                                            |\r\n| `description` | A human readable description to show in the template picker.                                                                     |\r\n\r\nFoam-specific variables (e.g. `$FOAM_TITLE`) can be used within template metadata. However, VS Code snippet variables are ([currently](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/pull/655)) not supported.\r\n\r\n#### `filepath` attribute\r\n\r\nIt is possible to vary the `filepath` value based on the current date using the `FOAM_DATE_*` variables. This is especially useful for the [[daily-notes]] template if you wish to organize by years, months, etc. Below is an example of a daily-note template metadata section that will create new daily notes under the `journal/YEAR/MONTH-MONTH_NAME/` filepath. For example, when a note is created on November 15, 2022, a new file will be created at `C:\\Users\\foam_user\\foam_notes\\journal\\2022\\11-Nov\\2022-11-15-daily-note.md`. This method also respects the creation of daily notes relative to the current date (i.e. `/+1d`).\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntype: daily-note\r\nfoam_template:\r\n  description: Daily Note\r\n  filepath: '/journal/$FOAM_DATE_YEAR/$FOAM_DATE_MONTH-$FOAM_DATE_MONTH_NAME_SHORT/$FOAM_DATE_YEAR-$FOAM_DATE_MONTH-$FOAM_DATE_DATE-daily-note.md'\r\n---\r\n\r\n# $FOAM_DATE_YEAR-$FOAM_DATE_MONTH-$FOAM_DATE_DATE Daily Notes\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Creating notes in the current directory\r\n\r\nTo create notes in the same directory as your currently active file, use the `FOAM_CURRENT_DIR` variable in your template's `filepath`:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\nfoam_template:\r\n  name: Current Directory Note\r\n  filepath: '$FOAM_CURRENT_DIR/$FOAM_SLUG.md'\r\n---\r\n\r\n# $FOAM_TITLE\r\n\r\n$FOAM_SELECTED_TEXT\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Best practices for filepath patterns:**\r\n\r\n- **Explicit current directory:** `$FOAM_CURRENT_DIR/$FOAM_SLUG.md` - Creates notes in the current editor's directory\r\n- **Workspace root:** `/$FOAM_SLUG.md` - Always creates notes in workspace root\r\n- **Subdirectories:** `$FOAM_CURRENT_DIR/meetings/$FOAM_SLUG.md` - Creates notes in subdirectories relative to current location\r\n\r\nThe `FOAM_CURRENT_DIR` approach is recommended over relative paths (like `./file.md`) because it makes the template's behavior explicit and doesn't depend on configuration settings.\r\n\r\n#### `name` and `description` attributes\r\n\r\nThese attributes provide a human readable name and description to be shown in the template picker (e.g. When a user uses the `Foam: Create New Note From Template` command):\r\n\r\n![Template Picker annotated with attributes](../../assets/images/template-picker-annotated.png)\r\n\r\n#### Adding template metadata to an existing YAML Frontmatter block\r\n\r\nIf your template already has a YAML Frontmatter block, you can add the Foam template metadata to it.\r\n\r\nFoam only supports adding the template metadata to _YAML_ Frontmatter blocks. If the existing Frontmatter block uses some other format (e.g. JSON), you will have to add the template metadata to its own YAML Frontmatter block.\r\n\r\nFurther, the template metadata must be provided as a [YAML block mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2798057), with the attributes placed on the lines immediately following the `foam_template` line:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nexisting_frontmatter: \"Existing Frontmatter block\"\r\nfoam_template: # this is a YAML \"Block\" mapping (\"Flow\" mappings aren't supported)\r\n  name: My Note Template # Attributes must be on the lines immediately following `foam_template`\r\n  description: This is my note template\r\n  filepath: `journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md`\r\n---\r\nThis is the rest of the template\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Adding template metadata to its own YAML Frontmatter block\r\n\r\nYou can add the template metadata to its own YAML Frontmatter block at the start of the template:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nfoam_template:\r\n  name: My Note Template\r\n  description: This is my note template\r\n  filepath: 'journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md'\r\n---\r\nThis is the rest of the template\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the note already has a Frontmatter block, a Foam-specific Frontmatter block can be added to the start of the template. The Foam-specific Frontmatter block must always be placed at the very beginning of the file, and only whitespace can separate the two Frontmatter blocks.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nfoam_template:\r\n  name: My Note Template\r\n  description: This is my note template\r\n  filepath: 'journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md'\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\nexisting_frontmatter: 'Existing Frontmatter block'\r\n---\r\nThis is the rest of the template\r\n```\r\n\r\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\r\n[daily-notes]: daily-notes.md \"Daily Notes\"\r\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/features/wikilinks/","title":"Wikilinks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Wikilinks\r\n\r\nWikilinks are internal links that connect files in your knowledge base using `[[double bracket]]` syntax.\r\n\r\n## Creating Wikilinks\r\n\r\n1. **Type `[[`** and start typing a note name\r\n2. **Select from autocomplete** and press `Tab`\r\n3. **Navigate** with `Ctrl+Click` (`Cmd+Click` on Mac) or `F12`\r\n4. **Create new notes** by clicking on non-existent wikilinks\r\n\r\nExample: [[graph-view]]\r\n\r\n## Placeholders\r\n\r\nWikilinks to non-existent files create [[placeholder]] links, styled differently to show they need files created.

Customize Your Settings\r\n\r\nReview and adjust `.vscode/settings.json` based on your preferences:\r\n\r\n- **Daily notes location** - where your daily notes are stored\r\n- **Image handling** - how pasted images are organized\r\n- **Link format** - with or without file extensions\r\n\r\n### 2. Set Up Your Inbox\r\n\r\nCreate `inbox.md` as your default capture location:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# Inbox\r\n\r\nQuick notes and ideas go here before being organized.\r\n\r\n## Today's Captures\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## To Process\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\n-\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Create Core Structure Notes\r\n\r\n## Workspace Organization Strategies\r\n\r\nEstablish your main organizational notes.\r\nYou can use any methodology, Foam is not opinionated.\r\n\r\nThe only recommendation is to get started, you can improve later.\r\n\r\nThe two main methods adopted by users are [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) and [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/).\r\n\r\n### The PARA Method\r\n\r\nOrganize around four categories:\r\n\r\n- **Projects** - Things with deadlines\r\n- **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities\r\n- **Resources** - Future reference materials\r\n- **Archive** - Inactive items\r\n\r\n### Zettelkasten Approach\r\n\r\nNumber-based system for atomic ideas:\r\n\r\n- **Permanent notes** - `202501251030-idea-title.md`\r\n- **Literature notes** - `book-author-year.md`\r\n- **Index notes** - `index-topic.md`\r\n\r\n### 4. Configure Daily Notes\r\n\r\nDaily notes are perfect for:\r\n\r\n- Daily planning and reflection\r\n- Meeting notes\r\n- Journal entries\r\n- Quick captures\r\n\r\nTest your daily notes setup:\r\n\r\n1. **Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`**\r\n2. **Type \"Foam: Open Daily Note\"**\r\n3. **Verify the note is created in the right location**\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can press `Alt+D` to open today's daily note, or `Alt+H` to open another day's daily note.\r\nUse the `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` to customize your daily note.\r\n\r\n## Best Practices for New Workspaces\r\n\r\n### 1. Start Small\r\n\r\n- Begin with just a few notes\r\n- Don't over-organize initially\r\n- Let structure emerge naturally\r\n\r\n### 2. Use Templates\r\n\r\n- Create templates for common note types\r\n- Maintain consistency across similar notes\r\n- Save time on repetitive formatting\r\n\r\n### 3. Link Early and Often\r\n\r\n- Use `[[wikilinks]]` liberally\r\n- Don't worry about creating \"perfect\" links\r\n- Foam handles broken links gracefully\r\n\r\n### 4. Regular Reviews\r\n\r\n- Weekly workspace cleanup\r\n- Archive completed projects\r\n- Identify missing connections\r\n\r\n## Syncing and Backup\r\n\r\nFoam works on simple files, you can add whatever backup method you prefer on top of it.\r\n\r\n### Git\r\n\r\nYour workspace is a Git repository:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"Add new notes and ideas\"\r\ngit push origin main\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also use other VS Code extensions to manage the git synching if that's helpful.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Sync Methods\r\n\r\n- **Cloud storage** - Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive\r\n- **Local backup** - Time Machine, File History\r\n- **Manual export** - Regular ZIP backups\r\n\r\n## What's Next?\r\n\r\nWith your workspace set up, you're ready to:\r\n\r\n1. **[Learn note-taking fundamentals](note-taking-in-foam.md)** - Master Markdown and writing effective notes\r\n2. **[Explore navigation](navigation.md)** - Connect your thoughts with wikilinks\r\n3. **[Discover the graph view](../features/graph-view.md)** - Visualize your knowledge network\r\n4. **[Set up templates](../features/templates.md)** - Standardize your note creation process\r\n\r\n## Getting Help\r\n\r\nIf you encounter setup issues:\r\n\r\n- Check the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for prerequisites\r\n- Visit the [FAQ](../faq.md) for common workspace problems\r\n- Join the [Foam Community Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/w)\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/getting-started/get-started-with-vscode/","title":"Using Foam with VS Code Features"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Using Foam with VS Code Features\r\n\r\nFoam builds on Visual Studio Code's powerful editing capabilities, integrating seamlessly with VS Code's native features to create a comprehensive knowledge management experience. This guide explores how to leverage VS Code's built-in functionality alongside Foam.\r\n\r\n### Keyboard shortcuts\r\n\r\nVS Code supports various **keyboard shortcuts**, the most important for us are:\r\n\r\n| Shortcut      | Action                        |\r\n| ------------- | ----------------------------- |\r\n| `cmd+N`       | create a new file             |\r\n| `cmd+S`       | save the current file         |\r\n| `cmd+O`       | open a file                   |\r\n| `cmd+P`       | use quickpick to open a file  |\r\n| `alt+D`       | open the daily note for today |\r\n| `alt+H`       | open the daily note for a day |\r\n| `cmd+shift+P` | invoke a command (see below)  |\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the [VS Code keyboard cheat sheets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference), where you can also see how to customize your keybindings.\r\n\r\n### Commands\r\n\r\nCommands make VS Code extremely powerful.\r\n\r\nTo invoke a command, press `cmd+shift+P` and select the command you want to execute.\r\nFor example, to see the Foam graph:\r\n\r\n- press `cmd+shift+P` to open the command bar\r\n- start typing `show graph`\r\n- select the `Foam: Show Graph` command\r\n\r\nAnd watch the magic unfold.\r\n\r\nTo see all foam commands, type \"foam\" in the command bar.\r\nFor more information on commands, see [commands on the VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about VS Code, check out their [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#first-steps).\r\n\r\n### Panels\r\n\r\nFoam integrates with VS Code panels to provide insights into individual notes and the whole knowledge base.\r\n\r\n- **`Foam: links`**: Shows all notes that link to and from the currently active note, helping you understand connections and navigate your knowledge graph\r\n- **`Foam: Orphaned Notes`**: Displays notes that have no incoming or outgoing links, helping you identify isolated content that might need better integration\r\n- **`Tag Explorer`**: Shows all tags used across your workspace in a hierarchical view, see [[tags]] for more information on tags\r\n- **`Foam: Graph`**: Visual representation of your note connections (also available as a separate graph view)\r\n\r\n### Styling and Themes\r\n\r\nVS Code is very configurable when it comes to themes and style. Find your ideal set up by running the command `Color Theme`.\r\nFor more information see the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/themes).\r\n\r\n### Multi-Cursor Editing\r\n\r\nEdit multiple locations simultaneously for efficient note management:\r\n\r\n**Basic Multi-Cursor:**\r\n\r\n- `Alt+Click` / `Option+Click` -

Unlike traditional file systems or notebooks, Foam lets you move through your knowledge by following connections between ideas. This guide will teach you how to navigate efficiently using wikilinks, backlinks, and other powerful features.\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Mastering navigation in Foam]_\r\n\r\n## Understanding Wikilinks\r\n\r\nWikilinks are the backbone of Foam navigation. They connect your thoughts and let you jump between related concepts instantly.\r\n\r\n### Basic Wikilink Syntax\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nI'm learning about [[Machine Learning]] and its applications in [[Data Science]].\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of my notes on [[Python Programming]] from yesterday.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you type `[[`, Foam shows you a list of existing notes to link to. If the note doesn't exist, Foam creates a placeholder that you can click to create the note later.\r\n\r\n### Wikilink Variations\r\n\r\n**Link to a specific heading:**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nSee the [[Project Management#Risk Assessment]] section for details.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Link to a specific block:**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nSee the [[Project Management#^block-id]] paragraph for details.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Link with alias:**\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nAccording to [[Einstein, Albert|Einstein]], imagination is more important than knowledge.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Autocomplete and Link Assistance\r\n\r\nFoam provides intelligent autocomplete when creating links:\r\n\r\n1. **Type `[[`** - Foam shows a dropdown of existing notes\r\n2. **Start typing** - The list filters to matching notes\r\n3. **Use arrow keys** to navigate suggestions\r\n4. **Press Enter** to insert the selected link\r\n\r\n## The Foam Graph\r\n\r\nFor a visual overview of your knowledge base, Foam offers a [[graph-view]]. This feature renders your notes as nodes and the links between them as connections, creating an interactive map of your thoughts.\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Navigation with the Foam Graph]_\r\n\r\n### Using the Graph\r\n\r\n1.  **Open the Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)\r\n2.  **Run the \"Foam: Show Graph\" command**\r\n3.

It is available as an on-premise or SaaS version. The following recipe was tested with the SaaS version, but should work the same way for the on-premise.\r\n\r\nThe following recipe is written with the assumption that you already have an [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) project.\r\n\r\n## Setup a Foam workspace\r\n\r\n1. Generate a Foam workspace using the [foam-template project](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template).\r\n2. Change the remote to a git repository in Azure DevOps (Repos -> Import a Repository -> Add Clone URL with Authentication), or copy all the files into a new Azure DevOps git repository.\r\n3. Define which document will be the wiki home page. To do that, create a file called `.order` in the Foam workspace root folder, with first line being the document filename without `.md` extension. For a project created from the Foam template, the file would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreadme\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Push the repository to remote in Azure DevOps.\r\n\r\n## Publish repository to a wiki\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project in a web browser.\r\n2. Choose **Overview** > **Wiki**. If you don't have wikis for your project, choose **Publish code as a wiki** on welcome page.\r\n3. Choose repository with your Foam workspace, branch (usually `master` or `main`), folder (for workspace created from foam-template it is `/`), and wiki name, and press **Publish**.\r\n\r\nA published workspace looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Azure DevOps wiki](../../assets/images/azure-devops-wiki-demo.png)\r\n\r\nThere is default table of contents pane to the left of the wiki content. Here, you'll find a list of all directories that are present in your Foam workspace, and all wiki pages. Page names are derived from files names, and they are listed in alphabetical order. You may reorder pages by adding filenames without `.md` extension to `.order` file.\r\n\r\n_Note that first entry in `.order` file defines wiki's home page._\r\n\r\n## Update wiki\r\n\r\nWhile you are pushing changes to GitHub, you won't see the wiki updated if you don't add Azure as a remote. You can push to multiple repositories simultaneously.\r\n\r\n1.  First open a terminal and check if Azure is added running: `git remote show origin`. If you don't see Azure add it in the output then follow these steps.\r\n2.  Rename your current remote (most likely named origin) to a different name by running: `git remote rename origin main`\r\n3.  You can then add the remote for your second remote repository, in this case, Azure. e.g `git remote add azure https://<YOUR_ID>@dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ID>/foam-notes/_git/foam-notes`. You can get it from: Repos->Files->Clone and copy the URL.\r\n4.  Now, you need to set up your origin remote to push to both of these. So run: `git config -e` and edit it.\r\n5.  Add the `remote origin` section to the bottom of the file with the URLs from each remote repository you'd like to push to. You'll see something like that:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[core]\r\n ...\r\n  (ignore this part)\r\n  ...\r\n[branch \"main\"]\r\n remote = github\r\n merge = refs/heads/main\r\n[remote \"github\"]\r\n url = git@github.com:username/repo.git\r\n fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*\r\n[remote \"azure\"]\r\n url = https://<YOUR_ID>@dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ID>/foam-notes/_git/foam-notes\r\n fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/azure/*\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n url = git@github.com:username/repo.git\r\n url = https://<YOUR_ID>@dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ID>/foam-notes/_git/foam-notes\r\n```\r\n\r\n6.  You can then push to both repositories by: `git push origin main` or a single one using: `git push github main` or `git push azure main`\r\n\r\nFor more information, read the [Azure DevOps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki).\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/publishing/publish-to-github-pages/","title":"GitHub Pages"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# GitHub Pages\r\n\r\n1.

The caveat is: we can't rely on GitHub Pages to host and deploy our website anymore, because the plugin we'll be using to let Jekyll support KaTeX doesn't play well together with GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\nThe alternative solution is to using [[publish-to-vercel]] for building and publishing our website, so before you start integrating KaTeX into your Foam project, please follow the instructions to host your Foam workspace on [[publish-to-vercel]] first.\r\n\r\n## Adding required plugins\r\n\r\nAdd the plugin `jekyll-katex` to your Foam workspace's `_config.yml` and `Gemfile` if you haven't done so already. For detailed instructions, please refer to the `#Adding a _config.yml` and `#Adding a Gemfile` in [[publish-to-vercel]].\r\n\r\n## Loading KaTeX JS and CSS\r\n\r\nBecause we are using KaTeX to render math, we will also need to import KaTeX's JS and CSS files from CDN. The official method to load these files is documented at: [KaTeX/KaTeX#starter-template](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX#starter-template). In our case, we will need to add the following code snippet to our `_layouts/page.html`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- _layouts/page.html -->\r\n---\r\nlayout: default\r\n---\r\n\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-AfEj0r4/OFrOo5t7NnNe46zW/tFgW6x/bCJG8FqQCEo3+Aro6EYUG4+cU+KJWu/X\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\r\n\r\n<!-- The loading of KaTeX is deferred to speed up page rendering -->\r\n<script defer src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-g7c+Jr9ZivxKLnZTDUhnkOnsh30B4H0rpLUpJ4jAIKs4fnJI+sEnkvrMWph2EDg4\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\r\n\r\n<!-- To automatically render math in text elements, include the auto-render extension: -->\r\n<script defer src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-mll67QQFJfxn0IYznZYonOWZ644AWYC+Pt2cHqMaRhXVrursRwvLnLaebdGIlYNa\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\" onload=\"renderMathInElement(document.body);\"></script>\r\n\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Adding liquid tags to wrap page content\r\n\r\nThe plugin `jekyll-katex` focuses on rendering:\r\n\r\n- Single math equations wrapped inside `katex` liquid tags like {% raw %}`{% katex %} ... {% endkatex %}`{% endraw %}.\r\n- Or multiple math equations in paragraphs wrapped inside {% raw %}`{% katexmm %} ... {% endkatexmm %}`{% endraw %}.\r\n\r\nIn our case, we'll be using the latter tag to wrap our {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %}. Wrap {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} in the liquid tags inside `_layouts/page.html` like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- _layouts/page.html -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n{% raw %}{% katexmm %} {{ content }} {% endkatexmm %}{% endraw %}\r\n<!-- ... -->\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Render equations in Foam's homepage as well\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that we only made modifications to the template `_layouts/page.html`, which means that `_layouts/home.html` won't have KaTeX support. If you wan't to render math in Foam's home page, you'll need to make the same modifications to `_layouts/home.html` as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, if all goes well, then our site hosted on Vercel will support rendering math equations with KaTeX after committing these changes to GitHub. Here's a demo of the default template with KaTeX support: [Foam Template with KaTeX support](https://foam-template.vercel.app/).\r\n\r\n\r\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\r\n[math-support-with-mathjax]: math-support-with-mathjax.md \"Math Support\"\r\n[publish-to-vercel]: publish-to-vercel.md \"Publish to Vercel\"\r\n[publish-to-vercel]: publish-to-vercel.md \"Publish to Vercel\"\r\n[publish-to-vercel]: publish-to-vercel.md \"Publish to Vercel\"\r\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\""},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/publishing/publish-to-github/","title":"Publish to GitHub"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Publish to GitHub\r\n\r\nThe standard [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) is ready to be published to GitHub, and GitHub pages.\r\n\r\n## Enable navigation in GitHub\r\n\r\nTo allow navigation from within the GitHub repo, make sure to generate the link references, by setting\r\n\r\n- `Foam › Edit: Link Reference Definitions` -> `withExtensions`\r\n\r\nSee [[link-reference-definitions]] for more information.\r\n\r\n## Customising the style\r\n\r\nYou can edit `assets/css/style.scss` to change how published pages look.\r\n\r\n\r\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\r\n[link-reference-definitions]: ../features/link-reference-definitions.md \"Link Reference Definitions\"\r\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\""},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/publishing/publish-to-netlify-with-eleventy/","title":"Publish to Netlify with Eleventy"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Publish to Netlify with Eleventy\r\n\r\nYou can use [foam-eleventy-template](https://github.com/juanfrank77/foam-eleventy-template) to generate a static site with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and host it online on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).\r\n\r\nWith this template you can\r\n\r\n- Have control over what to publish and what to keep private\r\n- Customize the styling of the site to your own liking\r\n\r\n## Publishing your foam\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to publish, import the GitHub repository you created with **foam-eleventy-template** into your Netlify account.

This workspace is a barebone Jekyll source website, which means we can customize and install plugins just like any other Jekyll websites.\r\n\r\nAs we won't be using GitHub Pages, we will be adding a few configuration files in order to help Vercel pick up on how to build our site.\r\n\r\n### Adding a `_config.yml`\r\n\r\nFirst, we'll need to add a `_config.yml` at the root directory. This is the Jekyll configuration file. In here, we will set the site's title, theme, repository and permalink options, and also tell Jekyll what plugins to use:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# _config.yml\r\ntitle: Foam\r\n# All the plugins we will be installing now that we won't be using GitHub Pages\r\nplugins:\r\n  - jekyll-katex  # optional\r\n  - jekyll-default-layout\r\n  - jekyll-relative-links\r\n  - jekyll-readme-index\r\n  - jekyll-titles-from-headings\r\n  - jekyll-optional-front-matter\r\n# The default Jekyll theme we will be using\r\ntheme: jekyll-theme-primer\r\n# The GitHub repository that we are hosting our foam workspace from\r\nrepository: user/repo\r\n# Generate permalinks in format specified in: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#built-in-formats\r\npermalink: pretty\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `theme` specifies a theme for our deployed Jekyll website. The default GitHub Pages template is called [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer). See Primer docs for how to customise html layouts and templates. We can also choose a theme if you want from places like [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/).\r\n\r\nThe `plugins` specifies a list of Jekyll plugins that we will be installing in the next section. As we won't be using GitHub Pages, we'll need to install these plugins that GitHub Pages installs for us under the hood.\r\n\r\n_If you want to use LaTeX rendered with KaTeX (which is what the plugin `jekyll-katex` does), you can specify it here. And yes, one of the benefits of deploying with Vercel is that we can use KaTeX to render LaTeX! More on: [[math-support-with-katex]]_\r\n\r\n### Adding a `Gemfile`\r\n\r\nNext up, we'll create another new file called `Gemfile` in the root directory. This is where we will let Vercel know what plugins to install when building our website.\r\n\r\nIn our `Gemfile`, we need to specify our Ruby packages:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Gemfile\r\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\ngem \"jekyll\"\r\ngem \"kramdown-parser-gfm\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-theme-primer\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-optional-front-matter\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-default-layout\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-relative-links\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-readme-index\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-titles-from-headings\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-katex\"  # Optional, the package that enables KaTeX math rendering\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Enable math rendering with KaTeX (optional)\r\n\r\nBesides adding the plugin `jekyll-katex` in `_config.yml` and `Gemfile`, we'll also have to follow the guides in [[math-support-with-katex]] to let our site fully support using KaTeX to render math equations.\r\n\r\n### Committing changes to GitHub repo\r\n\r\nFinally, commit the newly created files to GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Importing project to Vercel\r\n\r\nFirst, import our foam workspace (GitHub repository) to Vercel with [Vercel's _Import Git Repository_](https://vercel.com/import/git). Paste our GitHub repo's url and Vercel will automatically pull and analyze the tool we use to deploy our website. (In our case: Jekyll.)\r\n\r\nNext, select the folder to deploy from if prompted. If we are using the default template, then Vercel will default to the root directory of our Foam workspace.\r\n\r\nFinally, if all is successful, Vercel will show the detected framework: Jekyll. Press `Deploy` to proceed on publishing our project.\r\n\r\n![](../../assets/images/vercel-detect-preset.png)\r\n\r\nAnd now, Vercel will take care of building and rendering our foam workspace each time on push. Vercel will publish our site to `xxx.vercel.app`, we can also define a custom domain name for our Vercel website.\r\n\r\n\r\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\r\n[publish-to-github-pages]: publish-to-github-pages.md \"GitHub Pages\"\r\n[math-support-with-katex]: math-support-with-katex.md \"Katex Math Rendering\"\r\n[math-support-with-katex]: math-support-with-katex.md \"Katex Math Rendering\"\r\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\""},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/recipes/add-images-to-notes/","title":"Add images to your notes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Add images to your notes\r\n\r\nThis #recipe allows you to paste images on to your notes.\r\n\r\nVScode (since\r\n[1.79](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_copy-external-media-files-into-workspace-on-drop-or-paste-for-markdown))\r\nnow has the ability to paste images from the clipboard, or drag-and-drop image\r\nfiles, directly into markdown documents.

For example, compare the [original Foam documentation site](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) with a [Material for MkDocs version](https://djplaner.github.io/foam-with-material-for-mkdocs/) created using the simple configuration detailed below. Try out the search functionality on the Material for MkDocs version. This [digital garden](https://djon.es/memex) and this [blog](https://djon.es/blog/) provide more advanced examples of Foam content published using Material for MkDocs.\r\n\r\nThe following explains how to configure the [Material for MkDocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for the [MkDocs SSG](https://www.mkdocs.org) to publish your Foam.\r\n\r\nLike most SSGs (e.g. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is another SSG that can be [used to publish your Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/user/publishing/generate-gatsby-site)) site content is accepted in the form of Markdown files. Like those produced by Foam. SSGs differ in the languages they are written in (MkDocs is Python, Gatsby is Javascript and React) and the features they provide. MkDocs and Material for MkDocs are designed to support project documentation.  Gatsby is more general purpose and provides a nice feature set.\r\n\r\nYou choose your poison. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nTo use Material for MkDocs to publish your Foam you need:\r\n\r\n- An existing Foam workspace with content.\r\n- [Python installed on your computer](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).\r\n- Some familiarity and comfort with using the command line on your computer.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nConfiguring Material for MkDocs to publish your Foam involves the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. [Install Material for MkDocs and other requirements](#install-material-for-mkdocs-and-other-requirements).\r\n\r\n    Install the Material for MkDocs theme, MkDocs, and other required Python modules. \r\n\r\n2. [Configure Material for MkDocs for your Foam](#configure-material-for-mkdocs-for-your-foam).\r\n\r\n    Create a `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your Foam workspace directory. This file configures Material for MkDocs to work with your Foam.\r\n\r\n2. [Preview and test your site locally](#preview-and-test-your-site-locally).\r\n\r\n    Run MkDocs to preview and test your Material for MkDocs Foam site locally. Good for testing and local use.\r\n\r\n3. [Further customise Material for MkDocs](#further-customise-material-for-mkdocs).\r\n\r\n    Explore and leverage the additional configuration settings, possible customisations, and additional themes and plugins to customise your site to your needs.\r\n\r\n4. [Publish your site](#publish-your-site).\r\n\r\n    Publish your Material for MkDocs Foam site to the web for others to enjoy. There are many options for publishing your site, including GitHub, GitLab, Netlify, and others.\r\n\r\n### Install Material for MkDocs and other requirements\r\n\r\nMaterial for MkDocs provides [detailed installation instructions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) which cover the full range of options for installing and configuring Material for MkDocs. The following is a summary of the recommended process.\r\n\r\n1. Within your Foam workspace directory, create a [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/#using-pip-in-a-python-virtual-environment)\r\n\r\n    - `python -m venv .venv`\r\n    - `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `.venv\\Scripts\\activate` (Windows)\r\n\r\n2. Install Material for MkDocs\r\n\r\n    - `pip install mkdocs-material`\r\n\r\n3. Install additional Python modules\r\n\r\n    - `pip install mkdocs-roamlinks-plugin` \r\n    - `pip install mkdocs-exclude` \r\n\r\n### Configure Material for MkDocs for your Foam\r\n\r\nTo configure Material for MkDocs for your Foam workspace, create a `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your Foam workspace directory. Below you will find a sample `mkdocs.yml` file (adapted from the [foam-mkdocs-template repository](https://github.com/Jackiexiao/foam-mkdocs-template/tree/master)). Copy and paste it into your `mkdocs.yml` file, then edit it to suit your needs. In particular, don't forget to change the `site_name` and `site_url` to match your Foam workspace. Though this can be left a little later.\r\n\r\nMaterial for MkDocs provides documentation on both [minimal](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#minimal-configuration) and [advanced](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#advanced-configuration) configuration of `mkdocs.yml`. Which are revisited in the [customise section below](#further-customise-your-site)\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsite_name: My site # Change this to your site name\r\nsite_url: https://mydomain.org/mysite # change this\r\ntheme:\r\n  name: material\r\n  features:\r\n    - navigation.expand \r\n    - tabs \r\nmarkdown_extensions: \r\n  - attr_list \r\n  - pymdownx.tabbed\r\n  - nl2br\r\n  - toc:\r\n      permalink: '#' \r\n      slugify: !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify \r\n  - admonition\r\n  - codehilite:\r\n      guess_lang: false\r\n      linenums: false\r\n  - footnotes\r\n  - meta\r\n  - def_list\r\n  - pymdownx.arithmatex\r\n  - pymdownx.betterem:\r\n      smart_enable: all\r\n  - pymdownx.caret\r\n  - pymdownx.critic\r\n  - pymdownx.details\r\n  - pymdownx.inlinehilite\r\n  - pymdownx.magiclink\r\n  - pymdownx.mark\r\n  - pymdownx.smartsymbols\r\n  - pymdownx.superfences\r\n  - pymdownx.tasklist\r\n  - pymdownx.tilde\r\nplugins:\r\n  - search\r\n  - roamlinks \r\n  - exclude:\r\n      glob:\r\n        - \"*.tmp\"\r\n        - \"*.pdf\"\r\n        - \"*.gz\"\r\n      regex:\r\n        - '.*\\.(tmp|bin|tar)$'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Preview and test your site locally\r\n\r\nMkDocs provides a live preview server allowing you to preview and test your Material for MkDocs Foam site. The server will continue to rebuid your site as you write. \r\n\r\nThe simplest method to use the preview service is to run the following command whilst in the rood directory of your Foam workspace:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdocs serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the Material for MkDocs site for more, including [how to run the preview server via docker](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#previewing-as-you-write)\r\n\r\n### Further customise your site\r\n\r\nFurther customisation is available through expanding the configuration of Material for MkDocs, using additional MkDocs plugins, customising HTML/CSS, using Markdown extensions, writing your own Python scripts, and more.\r\n\r\nFor more on the available customisation paths, see the following:\r\n\r\n- Material for MkDocs [Advanced configuration](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#advanced-configuration) or the [Set up section](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/)\r\n\r\n    For more configuration options to be included in your `mkdocs.yml` file, including customising: colours, fonts, language, icons, navigation, header, footer etc.\r\n\r\n- Material for MkDocs [Customisation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/)\r\n\r\n    For advice on enhancing the visual design of your site by customising and replacing provided HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\r\n\r\n- Material for MkDocs [Reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/)\r\n\r\n    An overview of customisation methods that can be used directly within your Markdown files, including: admonitions, annotations, buttons, code blocks, content tabs, data tables, diagrams, grids, Mathematics, etc.\r\n\r\n- a [catalog of 300 MkDocs projects and plugins](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog#readme) \r\n\r\n    For functionality and ideas not included in Material for MkDocs, including: additional themes, plugins, and extensions.\r\n\r\n### Building and publishing your site\r\n\r\nAs a Static Site Generator (SSG), MkDocs generates a collection of static HTML and other types of files. Publishing your site involves building those HTML files and placing them onto your web server. The method will vary depending on your web server and hosting provider. \r\n\r\nThe MkDocs documentation site provides an explanation of the [simplest method to publish your site to any provider](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/#other-providers) using `mkdocs build` and `scp`.\r\n\r\nThe Material for MkDocs [publish page](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/) lists options for publishing to\r\n\r\n- GitHub using [mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-mkdocs)\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the simplest method, if you are already using GitHub to host your Foam workspace.\r\n\r\n- GitHub using [GitHub actions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/github-actions/)\r\n\r\n    A more automated method of publishing your site to GitHub, using GitHub actions.\r\n\r\n- [GitLab](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-mkdocs)\r\n\r\n- [Cloudflage pages](https://deborahwrites.com/guides/deploy-host-mkdocs/deploy-mkdocs-material-cloudflare/)\r\n\r\n- [Netlify](https://deborahwrites.com/guides/deploy-host-mkdocs/deploy-mkdocs-material-netlify/)\r\n\r\n- [Fly.io](https://documentation.breadnet.co.uk/cloud/fly/mkdocs-on-fly/#prerequisites)\r\n\r\n- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/using-bucket-website-with-mkdocs/)\r\n\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/recipes/export-to-pdf/","title":"Export to PDF"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Export to PDF\r\n\r\nThis #recipe shows how to export a note to PDF.\r\n\r\n## Required extensions\r\n\r\n- **[vscode-pandoc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrischinchilla.vscode-pandoc)**\r\n\r\n## Required third-party tools\r\n\r\n- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)\r\n- A [LaTeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) such as TeXLive (Linux), MacTeX (MacOS), or MikTeX (Windows)\r\n\r\nCheck that Pandoc is installed by opening a terminal and running `pandoc --version`.\r\n\r\nCheck that Pandoc can produce PDFs with LaTeX by running the following in the terminal.\r\n\r\n```\r\necho It is working > test.md\r\npandoc test.md -o test.pdf\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n1.

In VSCode, open `settings.json` for your user (or just for your workspace if you prefer), and add the following line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"pandoc.pdfOptString\": \"--from=markdown+wikilinks_title_after_pipe --resource-path $WORKSPACE/.pandoc --template foam --listings\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure to replace `$WORKSPACE/.pandoc` with the real full path to the `.pandoc` directory you created earlier.\r\n\r\n4. Open a Foam note in VSCode.\r\n\r\n5. Press `Ctrl` + `k`, `p`. Choose \"pdf\", and press `Enter`.\r\n\r\nThe PDF should look something like this:\r\n\r\n![Sample PDF output](../../assets/images/pdf_output.png)\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nIf you include a name in the `author` parameter in the YAML of the Foam note, that name will feature in the PDF header on the top left.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want syntax highlighting and frames around the codeblocks, remove `--listings` from the `pandoc.pdfOptString` parameter in `settings.json`.\r\n\r\n## Further customization\r\n\r\nIf you know some LaTeX, you can [tweak](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-template.html) the `foam.latex` template to your needs. Alternatively, you can supply another ready-made template such as [Eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template); just place the `TEMPLATE_NAME.latex` file in `$WORKSPACE/.pandoc`. You can also use all of Pandoc's [other functionalities](https://learnbyexample.github.io/customizing-pandoc/) by tweaking the `pandoc.pdfOptString` parameter in `settings.json`.\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/recipes/migrating-from-onenote/","title":"Migrating from OneNote"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Migrating from OneNote\r\n\r\nThis guide mostly duplicates the instructions at the repo for the PowerShell [script](https://github.com/nixsee/ConvertOneNote2MarkDown).\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe powershell script 'ConvertOneNote2MarkDown-v2.ps1' will utilize the OneNote Object Model on your workstation to convert all OneNote pages to Word documents and then utilizes PanDoc to convert the Word documents to Markdown (.md) format. It will also:\r\n\r\n* Create a folder structure for your Notebooks and Sections.\r\n* Process pages that are in sections at the Notebook, Section Group and 1st Nested Section Group levels.\r\n* Allow you you choose between putting all Images in a central '/media' folder for each notebook, or in a separate '/media' folder in each folder of the hierarchy.\r\n* Fix image references in the resulting .md files, generating relative references to the image files within the markdown document.\r\n* A title, description, and date header will be added to each file as well.\r\n* And more (see details at repo)!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Start the OneNote application. All notebooks currently loaded in [OneNote](https://getonetastic.com/download) will be converted.\r\n2. It is advised that you install [Onetastic](https://getonetastic.com/download) and the attached macro, which will automatically expand any collapsed paragraphs in the notebook. They won't be exported otherwise.\r\n    * To install the macro, click the New Macro Button within the Onetastic Toolbar and then select File -> Import and select the .xml macro included in the release.\r\n    * Run the macro for each Notebook that is open\r\n3. For the next sections, it is highly recommended that you use VS Code, and its embedded PowerShell terminal, as this allows you to edit and run the script, as well as check the results of the .md output all in one window.\r\n4. Whatever you choose, you will need to do the following:\r\n   1. Clone the script to your computer (see [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository), if you're unfamiliar with git).\r\n   2. Once cloned, navigate to the repo folder. In VS Code, use File -> Add Folder to Workspace, right click on the folder in the left side bar and click [Open In Integrated Terminal](../../assets/images/migrating-one-note.png).\r\n   3. Run the script by executing\r\n```.\\ConvertOnenote2Markdown-v2```\r\n    * if you receive an error, try running this line to bypass security:\r\n     ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process```\r\n    * if you still have trouble, try running both Onenote and Powershell as an administrator.\r\n5. It will ask you for the path to store the markdown folder structure. Please use an empty folder. If using VS Code, you might not be able to paste the filepath - right click on the blinking cursor and it will paste from clipboard. **Attention:** use a full absolute path for the destination.\r\n6. Read the prompts carefully to select your desired options. If you aren't actively editing your pages in Onenote, it is HIGHLY recommended that you don't delete the intermediate word docs, as they take 80+% of the time to generate. They are stored in their own folder, out of the way. You can then quickly re-run the script with different parameters until you find what you like.\r\n7. Sit back and wait until the process completes.\r\n8. To stop the process at any time, press Ctrl+C.\r\n9. If you like, you can inspect some of the .md files prior to completion. If you're not happy with the results, stop the process, delete the .md and re-run with different parameters.\r\n10. At this point, you should be ready to load the new directory into Foam!\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/recipes/how-to-write-recipes/","title":"How to Write Recipes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# How to Write Recipes\r\n\r\nThis is an example of how to structure a Recipe.

Users less familiar with VS Code are more likely to be familiar with `/` to trigger a command menu. Experienced VS Code users may be more likely to favour the command palette.\r\n- We can use `TabCompletionProvider` and `snippets` and mix them (maybe) via the following VS Code setting: `\"editor.snippetSuggestions\": \"inline\" | \"top\" | \"bottom\" | \"none\"`\r\n- For more discussion, consult the PR [here](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/pull/192).\r\n\r\n## Simplifying Markdown Syntax\r\n\r\nSome markdown syntax is difficult for users who have never authored markdown before. Take for example a checkbox/todo. The following syntax is required:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Something todo...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could provide snippets that expand out into the associated markdown syntax, like in the below GIF:\r\n![GIF demonstrating markdown snippets](../../assets/images/markdown-snippets.gif)\r\n\r\nThe JSON for these snippets can be found [here](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/pull/192#issuecomment-666736270).\r\n\r\n\r\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\r\n[custom-snippets]: ../features/custom-snippets.md \"Adding Custom Snippets\"\r\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\""},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/recipes/recipes/","title":"Recipes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"<!-- omit in toc -->\r\n\r\n# Recipes\r\n\r\nA #recipe is a guide, tip or strategy for getting the most out of your Foam workspace!\r\n\r\n- [Recipes](#recipes)\r\n  - [Contribute](#contribute)\r\n  - [Take smart notes](#take-smart-notes)\r\n  - [Discover](#discover)\r\n  - [Organise](#organise)\r\n  - [Write](#write)\r\n  - [Version control](#version-control)\r\n  - [Publish](#publish)\r\n  - [Collaborate](#collaborate)\r\n  - [Workflow](#workflow)\r\n  - [Creative ideas](#creative-ideas)\r\n  - [Other](#other)\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\n- Start by reading [[contribution-guide]]\r\n- If you discover features not listed here, we'd love to have them!

Established product with a paid plan, so may not be open to Foam-supportive changes and additions that don't benefit most users.\r\n\r\nVerdict: Good. By far best effort/outcome ratio would be to help improve GitJournal rather than building a [bespoke mobile app](#bespoke-mobile-app-for-foam).\r\n\r\n### GitHub Codespaces\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\n- Works out of the box just like the desktop app\r\n\r\nCons\r\n\r\n- not generally available quite yet\r\n- [Pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces)\r\n\r\nFor a quick demo, see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI5m4Uy8_4I>.\r\n\r\nVerdict: Good. Pricing should be reasonable for taking notes on the fly. Harder to assess for people who would constantly use Foam from mobile phone.\r\n\r\n## Bespoke mobile app for Foam\r\n\r\nGiven we already have a solution, why would we spend time and effort building a bespoke mobile app?\r\n\r\n- Taking notes on the go is a key part of a good note taking process, and the process should feel effortless\r\n- Having a custom app could help us support key user workflows in a more Foam-specific manner\r\n\r\nIf such an app was worth building, it would have to have the following features:\r\n\r\n- Instant loading and syncing for quick notes\r\n- Sleek, simple, beautifully designed user experience.\r\n- Ability to search and navigate forward links and back links (only in paid GitJournal version)\r\n- Killer feature that makes it the best note taking tool for Foam (?)\r\n\r\nGiven the effort vs reward ratio, it's a low priority for core team, but if someone wants to work on this, we can provide support!

Download the [GistPad extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) and then re-start Visual Studio Code\r\n\r\n1. Run the `GistPad: Sign In` command and then complete the authentication flow using your GitHub account\r\n\r\n1. Run the `GistPad: Open Repository` command and select the `Create repo from template...` or `Create private repo from template...` depending on your preference\r\n\r\n1. Select the `Foam-style wiki` template, and then specify a name for your Foam workspace (e.g. `my-foam-notes`, `johns-knowledge-base`)\r\n\r\nYour new repo will be created in your GitHub account, and the `Foam` welcome page will be automatically opened. If you already have an existing Foam workspace in GitHub, then when you run step #3 above, simply select or specify the name of the GitHub repository instead.\r\n\r\n> Note: If you have any and all feedback on how GistPad can be improved to support your Foam workflow, please don't hesitate to [let us know](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad)! 👍\r\n\r\n<img width=\"700px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87863222-c1b76180-c90d-11ea-87d9-04bee1c58a0d.png\" />\r\n\r\n## Managing your workspace\r\n\r\nOnce you've opened/created the Foam repository, it will appear in the `Repositories` view of the `GistPad` tab (the one with the little notebook icon). From this tree view, you can add/edit/delete/rename new pages, upload local files, as well as view the backlinks for each page (they appear as child notes of a page).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87234704-83a7c400-c388-11ea-90a8-2a660bef4dc5.png\" />\r\n\r\n## Editing your workspace\r\n\r\nWhen you create or open a page, you can edit the markdown content as usual, as well as [paste images](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#pasting-images-1), and create [`[[links]]` to other pages](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#links). When you type `[[`, you'll receive auto-completion for the existing pages in your workspace, and you can also automatically create new pages by simply creating a link to it.\r\n\r\nSince you're using the Visual Studio Code markdown editor, you can benefit from all of the rich language services (e.g. syntax highlighting, header collapsing), as well as the extension ecosystem (e.g. [Emojisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense)).\r\n\r\n## Navigating your workspace\r\n\r\nWhen editing a file, you can easily navigate `[[links]]` by hovering over them to see a preview of their contents and/or `cmd+clicking` on them in order to jump to the respective page. Furthermore, when you add a link to a page, a [backlink](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#backlinks) is automatically added to it.\r\n\r\nYou can view a page's backlinks using either of the following techniques:\r\n\r\n1. Expanding the file's node in the `Repositories` tree, since it's child nodes will represent backlinks. This makes it easy to browse your pages and their backlinks in a single hierarchical view.\r\n\r\n1. Opening a file, and then viewing it's backlinks list at the bottom of the editor view. This makes it easy to read a page and then see its backlinks in a contextually rich way.\r\n\r\n## Daily Pages\r\n\r\nIn addition to creating arbitrary pages, you can use GistPad for journaling or capturing [daily notes](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#daily-pages). Simply click the calendar icon in the `Repositories` tree, which will open up the page that represents today. If the page doesn't already exist, then it will be created in the workspace before being opened.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"700px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87234721-b356cc00-c388-11ea-946a-e7f9c92258a6.png\" />\r\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/tools/cli/","title":"Command Line Interface"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Command Line Interface\r\n\r\nCreate a CLI tool to allow running common Foam commands.
