Expanding the file's node in the `Repositories` tree, since it's child nodes will represent backlinks. This makes it easy to browse your pages and their backlinks in a single hierarchical view.\r\n\r\n1. Opening a file, and then viewing it's backlinks list at the bottom of the editor view. This makes it easy to read a page and then see its backlinks in a contextually rich way.\r\n\r\n## Daily Pages\r\n\r\nIn addition to creating arbitrary pages, you can use GistPad for journaling or capturing [daily notes](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#daily-pages).
