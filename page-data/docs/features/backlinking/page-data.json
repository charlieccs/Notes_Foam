While you create forward links intentionally with `[[wikilinks]]`, backlinks are discovered automatically by Foam.\r\n\r\n### Forward Links vs. Backlinks\r\n\r\n**Forward Links** (what you create):\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# Machine Learning Note\r\n\r\nI'm studying [[Neural Networks]] and [[Deep Learning]] concepts.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Backlinks** (what Foam discovers):\r\nIf you're viewing the \"Neural Networks\" note, Foam shows you that \"Machine Learning Note\" links to it, even though you didn't explicitly create that reverse connection.\r\n\r\nThis bidirectional linking creates a richer knowledge network than traditional hierarchical folders.\r\n\r\n## Accessing Backlinks - Connections Panel\r\n\r\nThe Connections panel shows both forward links and backlinks:\r\n\r\n1. **Open Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)\r\n2. **Type \"connections\"** and select \"Explorer: Focus on Connections\"\r\n3. **Use the filter buttons** to show only backlinks, forward links, or all connections\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Finding and opening the backlinks panel]_\r\n\r\n## Using Backlinks for Knowledge Discovery\r\n\r\n### 1. Finding Unexpected Connections\r\n\r\nBacklinks often reveal relationships you didn't consciously create:\r\n\r\n**Example:** While reviewing a \"Productivity\" note, backlinks might show connections from:\r\n\r\n- A cooking recipe (time management for meal prep)\r\n- A fitness routine (efficient workout planning)\r\n- A work project (team productivity strategies)\r\n\r\nThese diverse connections can spark new insights and cross-domain learning.\r\n\r\n### 2. Identifying Important Concepts\r\n\r\nNotes with many backlinks are often central to your thinking:\r\n\r\n- **Hub concepts** that connect many ideas\r\n- **Frequently referenced** resources or definitions\r\n- **Bridge topics** that span multiple domains\r\n\r\n### 3. Building Context Around Ideas\r\n\r\nBacklinks provide context for how you use concepts across different areas:\r\n\r\n- How you apply the same principle in various projects\r\n- Evolution of your thinking about a topic over time\r\n- Different perspectives you've encountered on the same idea\r\n\r\n_[📹 Watch: Using backlinks for knowledge discovery and research]_\r\n","excerpt":"Backlinks Backlinks are one of Foam's most powerful features for knowledge discovery.
